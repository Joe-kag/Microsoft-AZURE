# 🔐 Microsoft Azure: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

This project is based on the course **“Microsoft Azure: Identity and Access Management”** delivered by Microsoft Certified Cybersecurity Architect Expert **Bryan Li** on LinkedIn Learning. It demonstrates hands-on expertise in designing, implementing, and managing secure identity and access frameworks using **Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory).

---

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the core components of **Azure Identity and Access Management (IAM)**. It covers essential concepts, configurations, and governance tools required to secure Azure environments effectively, ensuring the right users and resources have the right access at the right time.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Microsoft Entra ID Core Concepts
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) license comparisons
- Creating and managing user accounts
- Managing and inviting external (guest) users
- Performing **bulk user operations**

### 🔹 Group, Device & Application Management
- Creating and managing **security groups** and **Microsoft 365 groups**
- Managing **devices** (joined, registered, and hybrid-joined)
- Registering and managing **enterprise applications**

### 🔹 Hybrid Identity & Administrative Units
- Understanding and implementing **Hybrid Identity**
- Configuring **Administrative Units** for scoped management

## 🔐 Authentication and Access Control

### ✅ Authentication Management
- Managing authentication methods
- Configuring **Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)**
- Implementing **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Setting up **Passwordless Authentication** (FIDO2, Windows Hello, Microsoft Authenticator)

### 🛡️ Conditional Access & Identity Protection
- Creating and enforcing **Conditional Access Policies**
- Implementing **Identity Protection** to detect and respond to risky sign-ins and users

### 🔐 Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Overview of **Azure RBAC** and **Microsoft Entra roles**
- Defining and customizing roles
- Implementing **role assignments** at the subscription, resource group, and resource levels

## 🧭 Governance and Monitoring

### 🕵️‍♂️ Identity Governance & Compliance
- Monitoring identity-related activities in **Microsoft Entra ID**
- Analyzing **Identity Secure Score** for best practice compliance
- Conducting **Access Reviews** to verify user access to resources
- Configuring **Entitlement Management** for automated access package workflows

### 👑 Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Overview of **Privileged Identity Management**
- Enabling **Just-In-Time (JIT) access** for high-privileged accounts
- Implementing **approval workflows**, **notifications**, and **PIM alerts**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Services Used

- **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)**
- **Azure Portal**
- **Azure Monitor**
- **Conditional Access Policy Engine**
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**
- **Access Reviews**
- **Entitlement Management**
- **Identity Secure Score Dashboard**

---

## ✅ Outcome

Through this project, I developed end-to-end skills in:
- Managing cloud and hybrid identities
- Securing authentication methods and enforcing conditional access
- Governing privileged access using Azure PIM
- Automating access governance through access reviews and entitlement workflows
- Applying RBAC and policy-based access to ensure least privilege

This knowledge ensures strong identity governance and helps safeguard resources across enterprise Azure environments.
